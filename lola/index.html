	<p>The first permanent state in the territory of present-day Ghana dates back to the 11th century.<br> Numerous <b>kingdoms</b> and empires emerged over the centuries, of which the most powerful was the Kingdom of Ashanti.<br>[12] Beginning in the 15th century, numerous European powers contested the area for trading rights, with the British ultimately establishing control of the coast by the late 19th century. Following over a century of native resistance, Ghana's current borders were established by the 1900s as the British Gold Coast. It became independent of the United Kingdom on 6 March 1957.[13][14][15]</p>
